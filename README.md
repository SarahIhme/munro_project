# Munro project
Keep track of which munros you have summited! 

## Technologies used

In this project I used JavaScript, Node.js and PostgresQL. PostgresQL keeps track of the users and the munros each user has done.

## Your personalised achievements

You can always check which mountains you have done, quickly see how many you have already hiked and see encouraging messages depending on your progress.

You can also filter based on names, height or if you have done the mountain by clicking on the column names.

To get a taste of the funcitonality of this application before you register, you can already access a general munro list with filtering functionality!
